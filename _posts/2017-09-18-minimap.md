			Many games placed a miniature map at a screen corner to aid players in orienting themselve within the game world.
			On the right side you can see a minimap that I created for my space game.
		</p>
		<p>In this tutorial, I like to show you, how easily it is to implement such a minimap in duality.</p>

## What we are going to do

One way to implement a minimap is to use a second camera, that is positioned above the player and looks towards him.
This second camera draws everything in the viewport to a `RenderTexture`.
Later on we are going to render that texture on the `ScreenOverlay`.

## 1. Setup the project

Download Duality from [here](duality.adamslair.net) and install it on your maschine. Run `DualityEditor.exe` so it can
grab all necessary packages from nuget. In this tutorial I'm using the [Kenny Space Shooter Assetpack](http://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux). It's completely free.

Now you can fill your scene with e.g a spaceship, a background-image and a meteor, like I did:

You also have to attach a second camera to the scene, which is going to be our `Minimap Camera`.

Set the Z-Position of our `Minimap Camera` e.g. to -800.

## 2. Setup the render target

To render the viewport of our `Minimap Camera` to a texture, we going to create a new `RenderTarget` **and** a `Texture` in the `Project View`.

![Create new rendertarget](https://i.imgur.com/8knLD6w.png)

After that we have to adjust the size of this texture. Just select the new created `Texture` and set the texture size to e.g. `512x512` inside the `Object Inspector`.

Now we going to tell the `Minimap Camera` that everything should be drawn on this new created texture. For this, we select the `Camera-Component` of our `Minimap Camera`, set the amount of `Passes` to `1` and assign our `Texture` to the `Output-Property`.

To test if we configured everything correctly, we can drag and drop the texture into the scene.
Move the `SpriteRenderer` a little bit, so we can see the differences.

If you see a "copy" of the spaceship and the meteor, than everything should be fine.

## 3. Create the HUD

Finally we can start coding! First of all we create a new `Component` called `MinimapRenderer`.
Just grab the code and paste it in the `MinimapRenderer-Component`.

```csharp
public class MinimapRenderer : Component, ICmpRenderer
{
	public float BoundRadius { get; }

	public ContentRef<Material> CameraTexture
	{
		get { return cameraTexture; }
		set { cameraTexture = value; }
	}

	public float MinimapSize
	{
		get { return minimapSize; }
		set { minimapSize = value; }
	}

	public float BorderSize
	{
		get { return borderSize; }
		set { borderSize = value; }
	}

	public float Padding
	{
		get { return padding; }
		set { padding = value; }
	}

	private ContentRef<Material> cameraTexture = null;
	private float minimapSize = 100;
	private float borderSize = 5;
	private float padding = 20;

	public bool IsVisible(IDrawDevice device)
	{
		return (device.VisibilityMask & VisibilityFlag.AllGroups) != VisibilityFlag.None &&
			   (device.VisibilityMask & VisibilityFlag.ScreenOverlay) != VisibilityFlag.None;
	}

	public void Draw(IDrawDevice device)
	{
		Canvas canvas = new Canvas(device);
		Vector2 screenResolution = DualityApp.TargetResolution;

		if (CameraTexture.IsAvailable)
		{
			float posX = screenResolution.X - minimapSize - borderSize - padding;
			float posY = screenResolution.Y - minimapSize - borderSize - padding;
			Vector2 minimapPos = new Vector2(posX, posY);

			// draw the border
			canvas.FillCircle(minimapPos.X, minimapPos.Y, minimapSize + borderSize);

			// draw the minimap camera
			canvas.State.SetMaterial(CameraTexture);
			canvas.FillCircle(minimapPos.X, minimapPos.Y, minimapSize);
		}
	}
}
```

> If you want to draw a quadratic minimap, just replace the code above with `canvas.FillRect(...)`

After that, add the `MinimapRenderer-Component` to your scene and asign the `Minimap-Texture` to the `CameraTexture-Property`.

Now the game should look like this:

Looks quite boring, right? Let's add some movement, so the camera can follow the player.
Add both cameras, `MainCamera` and `MinimapCamera` to the `Player-GameObject` as children.

We also create a new `PlayerController-Component` and add this to the `Player-GameObject`.

```csharp
[RequiredComponent(typeof(Transform))]
public class PlayerController : Component, ICmpUpdatable
{
	private const float speed = 5f;

	public void OnUpdate()
	{
		if (DualityApp.Keyboard.KeyPressed(Key.A))
		{
			Move(-Vector2.UnitX);
		}

		if (DualityApp.Keyboard.KeyPressed(Key.D))
		{
			Move(Vector2.UnitX);
		}

		if (DualityApp.Keyboard.KeyPressed(Key.W))
		{
			Move(-Vector2.UnitY);
		}

		if (DualityApp.Keyboard.KeyPressed(Key.S))
		{
			Move(Vector2.UnitY);
		}
	}

	public void Move(Vector2 direction)
	{
		GameObj.Transform.MoveBy(direction * Time.TimeMult * speed);
	}
}
```

The scene view hierarchy should looks like this:

... and the result:

I know, the controls sucks, but it should be fine for this tutorial.
